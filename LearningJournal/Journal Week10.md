## Week 10 -  Presentation Rehearsals 


### Learning Activities & Resources:
In week 10, we focused on finalizing and rehearsing our group presentation, which was then recorded and uploaded to YouTube. My role was to complete the extended portion of the presentation, specifically explaining the functionality and design of our group website. In order to accommodate the length and complexity of my presentation, my teammates and I chose to record our respective parts separately to ensure clarity and accuracy. After recording, we worked together to edit the video, using video editing software to merge my part with my teammates' contributions to create a complete work.

### Estimated Hours:
Spend 2.5 hours completing group tasks and journaling.

### Content Insights:
This week's activities gave me valuable insights into the complexities of collaborative project delivery and multimedia production. Producing a demo piece about a website requires understanding its technical and user experience components, which forced me to distill complex information into a concise, easy-to-understand narrative. The separate recording process emphasized the importance of clear communication and coordination within the team to maintain consistency in tone and messaging.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
The tasks in week 10 reflected the actual requirements of the position and honed my technical communication, teamwork, and multimedia production skills. The website presentation honed my ability to simplify complex ideas, which is very valuable for career development such as user experience design or technical writing. Collaborative recording and editing improved my adaptability and digital tool proficiency, thereby improving my employability. I realized the importance of iterative exercises for perfect delivery and proactive communication to coordinate team work. Looking forward, I will focus on improving my public speaking and editing skills for future projects.

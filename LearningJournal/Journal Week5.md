## Week 5 -  WordPress: Developing Child Themes


### Learning Activities & Resources:
In the fifth week of CP3402, I focused on the development and application of WordPress child themes. I consulted a lot of relevant materials and watched several teaching videos to gain a deeper understanding of its concepts and implementation methods. These tutorials demonstrated the creation process of child themes through practical operations, clearly explained the key steps, and gave me a more intuitive understanding of how to make custom adjustments.
During the learning process, I learned that directly modifying existing themes is not a good method, because when the theme is updated, all manually adjusted content may be overwritten. The role of a child theme is that it can inherit the style and functions of the parent theme while allowing users to customize it, making the modified part independent of the update, ensuring the security and stability of the website.

### Estimated Hours:
Spent 3 hours hosting, doing practicals and journaling.

### Content Insights:
In addition, through this study, I also realized that the child theme is not only a technical solution, it also affects the content management strategy. For a website that needs to be continuously updated, it is crucial to maintain the stability of the theme structure, and the reasonable application of the child theme can ensure the consistency of the front-end display while providing sufficient customization space to avoid damage to the style or function due to theme upgrades.
In general, this study made me pay more attention to the long-term maintainability issues in website development, and also deepened my understanding of the flexibility and scalability of the WordPress ecosystem.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
This week's study not only allowed me to master the development methods of WordPress child themes, but also improved my technical thinking and learning ability. This will not only directly help me in my future work in website development, but also make me more confident in solving technical problems, laying a good foundation for my future career development.

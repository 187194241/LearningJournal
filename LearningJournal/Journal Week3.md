## Week 3 - WordPress: installation, settings, content, navigation, using themes and plugins	 


### Learning Activities & Resources:
In the second week of CP3402 "Content Management System", I gradually mastered the basic functions of WordPress.

The plugin system of WordPress greatly enhances the scalability of the website. Users can install various plugins according to their needs, such as SEO optimization, security protection or social media integration. When I browsed the plugin library, I found that it provides a large number of free and paid plugins, with detailed user ratings and download data, which facilitates users to make more appropriate choices.

In addition, the WordPress theme determines the overall style and layout of the website. By changing different themes, the appearance of the site can be quickly adjusted to meet the needs of brand image or personal preferences. I tried several themes and found that they not only affect the visual presentation, but also have a direct impact on the user experience.

The backend operation interface is simple in design, and the various functions are clearly divided, which is convenient for managing website content. The article function is suitable for frequently updated information, while the page is more suitable for displaying fixed content such as "About Us" or "Contact Us". The media library provides file upload, editing and classification management functions to help users organize multimedia resources efficiently.

### Practical:
My WordPress and Joomla are hosted on the same website, both on AWS. But uploading an existing website to WordPress seems to be a paid project, so I gave up uploading the website on Joomla and chose to re-make a simple webpage. If I donâ€™t have to give up, I will choose to improve the website on Joomla later.

### Content Insights:
By exploring the various features of WordPress, I have gained a deeper understanding of website development and management. Its intuitive interface allows users to easily access and adjust various settings, while providing a range of tools to optimize content management and site structure. With the theme customization function, I can adjust the appearance of the website to match my startup brand image and further enhance the overall user experience.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
As a widely used CMS in the world, WordPress has equipped me with skills that are in great demand in the market. Whether I am responsible for website maintenance within a company or undertake projects as a freelancer, mastering WordPress can enhance my employment competitiveness. In addition, learning plugins and theme customization has equipped me with the ability to optimize websites and build brands, which is very helpful for entrepreneurial projects.

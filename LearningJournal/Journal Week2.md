## Week 2 - Overview of CMSs

### Learning Activities & Resources:
In the second week of the CP3402 â€“ Content Management Systems course, I explored the core concepts behind content management systems and dynamic websites.

A content management system (CMS) is a platform that simplifies the creation and management of web content, allowing users to store data in a database and display it through a website interface. The main advantage of using a CMS is that it eliminates the need for complex coding, as it takes care of the technical aspects. This allows content creators to focus on adding and editing the content itself, rather than dealing with the intricacies of HTML, CSS, and other programming languages.

In contrast, static websites are built using fixed files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These websites serve the same content to every visitor, and changes require manual editing of the code. Dynamic websites, on the other hand, are more complex; they pull data from various databases and dynamically generate content based on user interaction, time, location, and other personalized elements.

While static websites are quick to set up, cost-effective, and easy to maintain, they lack the ability to scale and offer limited customization. Dynamic websites, while resource-intensive and more complex to build, offer a more engaging and personalized experience for users. CMS greatly simplifies the creation and management of dynamic websites, making it easier to deal with the technical aspects of website development and content publishing.

### Practical:
For my startup, I chose the coffee shop idea. In this week's practice, I used AWS to host my Joomla website.

### Estimated Hours:
Spent 6 hours hosting, doing practicals and journaling.

### Content Insights:
Understanding how content management platforms operate fundamentally changed the way I think about web development. My breakthrough came when I analyzed the difficulties static pages faced in basic interactions with dynamic sites that evolved through database connections. This understanding led me to prioritize dynamic architectures, enabling features like automatic content updates and seamless integration of user authentication systems. Now I can focus on designing responsive interfaces instead of manually rebuilding pages, knowing that the backend will dynamically adapt to visitor input and content changes.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Navigating the Joomla dashboard was a fun experience, as I had to explore and experiment with each feature to fully grasp how they worked. This hands-on approach sparked my curiosity about content management systems and web development, and I can see how valuable these skills will be in the future, both at work and for my own business website.

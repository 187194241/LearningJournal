## Week 6 -  Project/client introduction, group project management 


### Learning Activities & Resources:
We spent most of the class time to successfully build a team collaboration environment, including Slack channels, GitHub repositories, and Trello boards. In addition, we also connected our respective LinkedIns. In order to improve efficiency, we successfully integrated GitHub and Trello into Slack, so that all important updates can be viewed on the same platform without having to switch applications frequently. Trello is very helpful in task management. It not only clearly assigns work, but also tracks the progress of each member to ensure the smooth progress of the project.

### Team Contribution:
1. Create a Trello group and invite members to join.
2. Create a slack account and link your GitHub repository and Trello to slack.

### Estimated Hours:
Spend 2.5 hours completing group tasks and journaling.

### Content Insights:
At the beginning of the project, we built several collaboration tools and successfully integrated them into Slack to improve the efficiency of communication and task management. GitHub is used for version control to ensure that team members can collaborate on development, while Trello helps assign tasks and track progress. The combination of these tools makes project management clearer and reduces the time cost of repeated communication.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
This project not only improved our technical capabilities, but also cultivated our experience in teamwork and project management. When using GitHub for version control, we became familiar with the best practices of collaborative development, such as branch management and code submission. The application of Trello taught us how to efficiently assign tasks and track progress, while the integration of Slack improved communication efficiency. These skills are crucial in the workplace, whether it is software development, product management or remote collaboration, and will bring direct competitive advantages.

## Week 7 -  PHP Programming


### Learning Activities & Resources:
In week 7, I learned the basics of PHP programming. PHP is a server-side scripting language used in web development to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Through this assignment, I practiced key PHP concepts such as echo, conditional statements, loops, functions, and including external files.
I encountered some challenges along the way, especially in structuring the PHP code and ensuring proper styling with CSS. However, I was able to create a simple website that met my requirements, which was a movie review website. This experience helped me understand PHP better, and I look forward to learning more advanced concepts in the future.

## Week 1 - Subject Intro & Web Design Basics

### Learning Activities & Resources:
In the first week of CP3402, I focused on reviewing the basics of HTML and CSS. The use of GitHub repositories was also a focus that I needed to relearn, as it was very important for me to record and publish exercises.

I had previously completed the CP1406 course, so I was able to review it using the resources in the course. The HTML code should be clearly structured and avoid redundancy, and the nesting relationship should not be wrong. The CSS code should pay attention to the naming convention, and also avoid duplication and redundancy, and make different responsive designs according to different devices. I relearned the layout of pages, tables, and forms.

I had a problem when thinking about the content and design of the website. Because I have difficulty making choices, I chose a lot of options, but it was difficult to choose. So I asked my friends, and through repeated comparisons, I finally determined the actual options and alternative options.

### Practical:
For my startup, I am going to create a website for a coffee shop where users can learn about and purchase coffee beans, brewing equipment, and other related products. The website will also provide resources such as brewing tips, coffee recipes, and coffee origin information for coffee lovers to learn more. In addition, it will provide customers with ways to contact the store for inquiries or view upcoming events. To ensure that the website is both attractive and useful, I will study existing coffee shop websites to gather inspiration and identify features that can enhance the user experience.

### Alternative idea:
Design a website for a photography company. The website will showcase a beautiful photo gallery, offer relevant photography services and allow detailed price enquiries. Clients will also have access to a contact form for bookings and enquiries, ensuring that those seeking professional photography have a quality experience.

### Estimated Hours:
Spent 5 hours with re-learning, doing practical and journaling.


### Content Insights:
Having a solid understanding of web design is essential to building efficient and user-friendly websites. This knowledge helped me effectively lay the foundation in a content management system. A key aspect of web design is to identify the target audience and create user pages that attract their attention. Establishing clear goals, defining key messages, and planning the structure using wireframes and navigation flows are key steps. Once the framework is ready, visual elements such as typography, color schemes, and responsive layouts are refined to create an engaging and cohesive website that resonates with users. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Web design and development fosters creativity and problem-solving skills that will serve me well in the future. This field not only supports building engaging online platforms, but also develops skills in project management, user experience design, and more. For me, it is more than just a practical tool, it is an opportunity to turn my curiosity about how websites work into something meaningful to explore and pursue. Whether as a hobby or a stepping stone to a future career, web design provides an opportunity to constantly learn and adapt.

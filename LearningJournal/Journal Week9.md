## Week 9 -  CSS pre-processing with Sass  


### Learning Activities & Resources:
In week 9, I created a simple website using Sass to demonstrate key features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance. I first set up the project structure, writing the HTML in index.html and then styling it with Sass in scss/main.scss. To compile my Sass code, I followed a manual workflow, installing Dart Sass and running the command sass scss/main.scss css/main.css in the terminal, and automatically compiling changes using sass --watch scss:css. This week's work provided a hands-on approach to learning Sass, allowing me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world projects.

### Estimated Hours:
Spend 2 hours completing group tasks and journaling.

### Content Insights:
Week 9's assignment was to use Sass for CSS preprocessing, which taught me how Sass can enhance the styling process in web development. For example, using variables to define colors and spacing allowed me to update the values ​​in one place, ensuring consistency across the entire site. Nesting helped me organize related styles in a hierarchical manner, making the code more readable. I also created a responsive text mixin to handle font sizing for different screen sizes, which taught me how to write reusable code for responsive designs. Additionally, manually compiling Sass and encountering deprecation warnings made me realize the importance of staying up to date with evolving tools and web development best practices. Overall, this assignment highlighted how Sass can streamline workflows and improve code quality, laying a solid foundation for building more complex web projects in the future.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Through the Week 9 assignments, I learned to use Sass as a CSS preprocessor, which gave me a deeper understanding of how to create efficient and maintainable stylesheets, a key skill for my future career as a web developer. In this week's assignment, I implemented Sass features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance, which allowed me to understand how these tools can simplify style workflows and reduce duplication of code. In addition, exploring Sass compilation commands such as sass --watch gave me a deep understanding of how to set up an efficient development workflow. This experience allowed me to effectively contribute to real-world projects that require concise and efficient styles, enhancing my preparation for a career in web development.
